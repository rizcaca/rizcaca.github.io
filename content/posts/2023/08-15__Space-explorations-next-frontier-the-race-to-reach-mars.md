Sure! Here’s a copywriting example based on the phrase "I hate accidents, except when we went from friend to this love
  
Life is full of unexpected twists, and some moments feel like they were never meant to happen. I used to hate accidents, those little stumbles and detours that throw life off course. But then, there was that one moment, that beautiful "accident" that changed everything. It was the day our paths shifted, and we found ourselves on a journey neither of us saw coming.
  
We were friends—just friends—for the longest time. Laughing, talking, sharing those inside jokes no one else could understand. It was simple, comfortable. But then, without warning, something changed. That casual closeness became something more, something electric. And suddenly, those small, accidental moments we shared felt destined.
  
From the outside, it might have seemed like a lucky coincidence. But in my heart, I know it was meant to be. We went from being "just friends" to something deeper, something powerful. Now, every glance, every word, feels like part of a story only we could write. It’s no longer just an accident—it’s a love that sparks and ignites something new every day. 
  
Because sometimes, life’s best moments are born from the unexpected. I hated accidents—until I realized that our story was one of them. And now, I wouldn’t change a single thing.
